Enter your MySQL Password in the field for `DB_PW`

(If you rename the `DB_NAME` data, be sure to update the `schema.sql` file found in the `db/` directory.)

Once the .env file was created. Run the following commands in the terminal.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm i sequelize`
3. `npm i mysql2`
4. `npm i express`
5. `npm run seed`
6. `npm start`
